                <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Home-based drug delivery systems are one way of managing clinical decision making at
the point of care. They offer the opportunity for healthcare professionals to have instant
access to a wide range of clinical information that may refer to individual patients, but
the ability to access information such as clinical guidelines and protocols will only
enhance and support the care process.</p>
                <h2>Clinical Exemplar</h2>
                <hr style= "border-top:2px solid black">
                <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asthma is a condition that affects the airways (bronchi) of the lungs. From time to time
the airways constrict in people who have asthma. The condition can commence at any
age, but it most commonly starts in childhood. At least 1 in 10 children, and 1 in 20 adults,
have asthma in the UK. Around 1500 people die from asthma in the UK each year (National
Asthma Campaign, 2001).</P>
                <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asthma in the UK places a high economic burden on both primary and secondary
healthcare systems, at an estimated annual cost of over £850 million (Office for National
Statistics). One in ten asthmatics that experience severe or moderately severe symptoms
fail to control their condition adequately, even with the best clinical and preventative
management available. Integrated drug delivery systems have the potential for easing
the economic burden on the NHS with improved patient care. Improved delivery of drugs
to the lungs in terms of both the ability to deliver larger quantities of drugs to the correct
region of the lung, combined with improved patient compliance to prescribed treatment
regimens, will result in better disease management with less need to resort to expensive
“relief care” strategies and will slow down progression to severe disease status.</p>
                <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Also, very few asthmatics have a documented self-management plan that explains when
to take their medication, the use of peak flow meters to measure the speed of air blown
out of the lungs, and what to do if their asthma condition deteriorates (Lorig, K.R., Sobel,
D.S., Stewart, A.L., Brown, B.W., Bandara, A., Ritter P., et al., 1999). Traditionally patients
are asked to keep a manual diary over a defined time period such as two weeks, charting
peak flow readings as a method of assessing a patient’s current clinical state. Regular
peak flow readings are a recognised method of assessing how well prescribed treatments
are working. As a chronic disease, it is essential to involve patients in decisions relating
to the development of a tailored care plan for the treatment of asthma, this will result in
the more effective delivery of healthcare to the individual patient and to asthmatics as
a whole. Patients (and clinicians) must learn how to use their inhalers correctly. The
practice nurse or doctors have pivotal roles to play in educating patients how to use an
inhaler properly. It is easy to demonstrate in a healthcare environment but ongoing homebased monitoring may ensure better device compliance for specific groups such as the
newly diagnosed or teenagers. Empirical evidence shows that these groups may have
compliance issues relating to the use of inhaled therapies. Patients must agree on an
“asthma action plan” with a nominated clinician. This means that adjustments to the dose
of the prescribed inhalers, depending on the symptoms and/or peak flow readings can
be made at a relevant point in time.</p>
                <h2>Stakeholders</h2>
                <hr style= "border-top:2px solid black">
                <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Patients are now increasingly recognised for the central role they play in the healthcare
process. They must be involved and consulted at every stage of the process. For a homebased drug delivery device to provide effective treatment and collect relevant information, the patient and/or carer must understand why the device is being used, agree to its
use and understand and accept a degree of responsibility for their role in the changing
relationship between clinician and patient. The partnership that develops between
patient and clinician will benefit patients’ individual knowledge and will complement
clinicians’ general knowledge about a specific chronic disease. The pooling of this
knowledge will in effect support the effective management of chronic diseases.
Clinicians should have skills that allow them to embrace novel innovations in drug
delivery systems. Many current clinical practitioners are still resistant to the roll out of
ICT within the NHS. This resistance may be explained by a fear of change, the inability
to embrace changes in clinical practice, and the empowered role of the patient in the car process.</p>
                <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Home-based drug delivery devices are one of the tools that can be utilised to support
clinical knowledge management in the modern healthcare setting by delivering concise,
appropriate and timely clinical information relating to an individual patient’s clinical state
in “real time” to key stakeholders involved in the care and management of chronic clinical
conditions. Collection and storage of clinical data electronically at the point of care offers
healthcare professionals instant access to clinical data such as medication history and
test results from remote locations. Mobile access also allows healthcare professionals
to access and update care plans, clinical guidelines and protocols, thus tailoring care by
having access to detailed information relating to an individual patient.</p>
                <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, not all clinicians are comfortable or ready to use mobile devices in clinical
practice. The benefits of using mobile health technology at the point of care will only be
demonstrated by widespread adoption into clinical practice. For example, the use of
handheld computers to access clinical guidelines and protocols etc, especially by junior
doctors in secondary care is becoming more widespread. Use by all clinical stakeholders
at the point of care should be encouraged, in order to benefit patient care. As adoption
of these devices becomes more commonplace, the opportunity arises for innovative uses
in the clinical setting to be explored.</p>
                <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The management of chronic clinical conditions often involves community healthcare
practitioners. Access to timely information relating to a patients condition will support
home-based care. In the past, relatives and neighbours often provided clinical care at
home, clinicians and allied health professionals played a small role in the care of the
average patient due to the related cost of healthcare. When the NHS was established,
the focus of care for chronic conditions transferred to the “free” primary and secondary
healthcare systems. Today, home- and self-care are re-emerging in response to cost
pressures, the emergence of the Internet as a conduit of health information to patients,
and by the diffusion of inexpensive computer technology as an aid to medical decisionmaking at the point of care. The benefits of home based drug delivery systems will be
judged on patient outcomes as well as the reduction in costs relating to the provision
of healthcare to support the ongoing treatment of chronic conditions.</p>
                <h2>Standards</h2>
                <hr style= "border-top:2px solid black">
                <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Issues surrounding the security of electronic patient records may impede development
and implementation of innovative home-based drug delivery systems. Time spent
debating this issue without the underpinning knowledge of international standards can
often lead to an insular focus on ICT development and its ongoing benefits to the
provision of patient centred care. Security and privacy of clinical data are at the forefront
of any debate concerning mobile health. It is essential that uniform data standards for
patient information and the electronic exchange of that information be adopted on a
worldwide basis and are embedded in system development.</p>
                <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recently, the US government has recommended that Health Level Seven (HL7) be
recognised as the core-messaging standard (Health Level 7). Standards development
must address issues such as security and the protection of data privacy, while facilitating
communication between individuals. In developing a system for home-based drug
delivery systems, patient–clinician communication must be structured and secure to
ensure reliability and relationships underpinned by trust to be developed. Essential data
must be clearly represented within a document structure (Nygren et al., 1998) Adherence
to standards will allow analysis of the data collected and enable clinical outcomes to be
communicated to the wider clinical community without an individual patient’s privacy
being compromised.</p>
                <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Communication of electronic clinical data and information across platforms should not
be device specific. The electronic provision of clinical information, using an extensible
mark up language (XML) format for interoperability, is a stated UK Government target
that is endorsed by the National Health Service Information Authority (NHSIA).
Regardless of which device is chosen, the use of XML facilitates electronic document
management and workflow, and allows tasks to be distributed amongst multi-professional healthcare personnel that will result in the optimisati</p>
                <h2>Current Prescribing Practice</h2>
                <hr style= "border-top:2px solid black">
                <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a wide range of inhalers available for the delivery of drugs to the lung. Studies
have shown that asthmatics do not use prescribed inhalers correctly (Thompson, Irvine,
Grathwohl, & Roth, 1994). The most effective inhaler is one that will be used by the patient
on a regular basis and in an effective manner. As “poorly” compliant patients are often
at risk of frequent attacks, it may be desirable to develop drug delivery devices that can
capture data relating to use and feed this information into an electronic healthcare record
system, accessible by all stakeholders in the care process, in order to support home based
patient care and facilitate clinical knowledge management.
</p>
                <h2>Mobile Devices</h2>
                <hr style= "border-top:2px solid black">
                <br>
                <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mobile health solutions allow for a point of care interaction regardless of whether the
patient is in hospital, at home or elsewhere in the community (Price & Summers, 2004).
Mobile devices can assist health professionals in their day-to-day clinical environment
by facilitating the provision of timely information. Mobile devices can also be of use in
medical research, used for clinical trials to record and transmit data that are costly to
capture by traditional methods. It is essential that the clinical information is delivered in
“real time” and can be readily accessed and understood by all stakeholders, including
patients, who are involved in the care process. The development of an integrated drug
delivery system enables all stakeholders, including patients and clinicians, to add value
to the care process. The smart interface and the use of a patient diary provide a solution
to the management of complex clinical communication issues by allowing documents to
be stored electronically and retrieved at will. It is crucial that these documents are
available in various formats and have the capability to be delivered to a wide range of
platforms, depending on preference and circumstances of use. The device holds
information that can be read in context of the recipient—this means that careful choice
terms have to be used so as to avoid misinterpretation. It is clear that the integration of
mobile devices into the healthcare process will demonstrate considerable benefit to UK
plc by reducing the economic burden on primary, secondary and tertiary care.</p><br>
                <h2>Clinical Knowledge Management</h2>
                <hr style= "border-top:2px solid black">
                <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Data captured by the drug delivery device can be used to create useful information for
both clinicians and patients. The information generated must be about the right person,
stored in a medium that is accessible and delivered at the right time by any specified
delivery device, such as mobile phones, palmtops as well as desktop PC’s. A critical
element to the successful integration of mobile-devices must be commitment by all
stakeholders, at all stages from development, implementation through to adoption into
daily use. Home-based drug delivery systems must provide efficient and cost effective
care for patients, focusing on preventing complications through the use of alerts
generated by the system when recorded results fall outside the ‘agreed’ patient profile,
negotiated by individual patients and their nominated clinician.</p>
                <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Issues relating to the adoption of home based drug delivery devices include awareness
of users previous experience relating to ICT in general, the device used to transmit and
receive data, the identification of data that has specific relevance to a nominated clinician
and the acceptability of filtering information in order to generate appropriate clinical
information to the right person at the right point in time. A rigorous evaluation process
will identify further issues generated when the device is integrated into the care process.</p>
                <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to take advantage of the developments surrounding electronic clinical note
keeping, a device has been developed to deliver drugs to the lungs, initially to treat the
symptoms of chronic asthma, but with planned exploitation routes to include diabetes

            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and pain management. An integrated drug delivery system including a smart interface
and patient diary capability allows documents to be stored electronically and retrieved
at will. It is crucial that these documents are available in various formats and have the
capability to be delivered to a wide range of platforms, depending on preference and
circumstances of use. The device will also hold information that crosses various
organisational boundaries, to be read in context of the recipient—this means that careful
choice of terms has been used so as to avoid misinterpretation. It is clear that the device
possesses considerable benefit to UK plc by reducing the economic burden on primary
and secondary care.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to investigate the elements to be utilised for data capture and dissemination of
clinical information a set of typical Use Cases was generated, describing patient and
clinical aspects, the device to systems interfaces, and administrative functions. Investigation and mapping of e-health capabilities, such as generic search, retrieval and
visualisation took place. The first draft of the functional specification required for the
integration of data generated and captured from the drug delivery device, is described
below.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The system is configured to accept sign-on from patients, carers and clinical staff.
Demographic information will initially be populated locally, but later will be drawn from
the local Community Index (Exeter system). Patient ID, initially populated locally using
NHS numbers where possible, will later be drawn from the Community Index. Patient
registration can take place by registering the device against a patient—which would need
to be managed carefully. If the device is issued to a new patient without the system being
updated, then the data will be associated with the wrong patient. Alternatively, all data
are supplied with a patient ID (e.g., NHS number). This would mean that the device is
either capable of holding an ID for the user or that the patient submits data in a two-phase
process, by signing onto the system and then providing a password. Patient folders are
automatically created when the patient is positively identified. In order to achieve
maximum coverage for “alerts” to nominated health professionals, it is essential that
clinicians are able to select a delivery device that they feel most comfortable with. The
options available include: mobile phones, PDAs, land line phones, and fax.</p>
